1. Write three different strings into the driver from app.
   a) "Mirafra"
   b) "Technologies"
   c) "Hyderabad"

   and read all the strings at a time

2. write the above strings seperately and read them seperately from the driver.
    (implement write and read consecutively/alternatively)

3. write/insert/push the string "technologies" after the string "Mirafra" before the string "Hyderabad"  and read all.
   o/p: "Mirafra technologies Hyderabad"(1 and 3 are same)

4. wap to make the user to write and read from the driver. Make sure that when one user/process is writing or reading from the driver the
   other user/process cannot enter into the driver.?

5. wap to enter a string from the app. The driver need to reverse the string and send back to the app?

6. wap to enter max of 4k bytes into the driver. the driver should not accept more than that max limit.

7. wap to initialize 1k stars (1024 *'s) into the driver and come back to 10th position and write "sree embedded" 
   and go to the 100th position and write the string "Technologies" then read the complete string and display from app?
     
8. Restrict the size of the buffer maximum to 1000 bytes in driver and do the 7th program. what is your observation?
